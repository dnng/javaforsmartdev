    <p>Create a set of classes simulating a police officer issuing a parking ticket.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Class - ParkedCar has the following responsibilities:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <ul>
                    <li>To know the car's make, model, color, license number and number of minutes the car has been parked.</li>
                </ul>
            </blockquote></lip>Class - ParkingTicket has the following responsibilities:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <ul>
                    <li>To report the make, model, color and license number of an illegally parked car.</li>
                    <li>Report the fine - which is $25.00 for first hour plus $10.00 for each additional hour</li>
                    <li>Report the name and badge number of the police officer issuing the ticket.</li>

    <p>Design to simulate a system where a police officer issues a parking ticket.</p>
    <p>You should design a set of classes that work together as a Parking Simulator.</p>
    <h2 id="designing">Designing</h2>
    <p>Similar to the approach followed in the previous task, letâ€™s decide what classes, methods and fields should be required.</p>
    <p>Since the PoliceOfficer will make the decision on whether to issue ticket, issueTicket method belongs to PoliceOfficer. ParkedCar, ParkedTicket and ParkedMeter are independent entities described below.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>ParkedCar Class has the following responsibilities:</dt>
        <dd><ul>
            <li>To know the car's make, model, color, license number and number of minutes the car has been parked. Create getter and setter methods for all the fields.</li>
        </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>ParkingMeter Class only responsibility is as follows:</dt>
        <dd><ul>
            <li>To know the number of minutes of parking time that has been purchased.</li>
        </ul>

        <dt>ParkingTicket Class has the following responsibilities:</dt>
        <dd><ul>
